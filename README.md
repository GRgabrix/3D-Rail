**This asset pack updates the flat rail textures in Minecraft with detailed 3D models, giving your minecart tracks a more realistic look while still maintaining the style of the original textures.**

The tracks now feature raised wooden rails and ties, and a decent amount of depth, improving immersion while still remaining true to the original aesthetic.
